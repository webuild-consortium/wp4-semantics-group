# WE BUILD WP4 Semantics Group

Hi, 

Semantics is currently a bit puzzled, since we feel there's no idea to produce any serious "semantic models" of any attestation unless the attestations themselves maintain a machine-readable and useable connection to their underlying data model. We're talking therefore about the necessity to use W3C VCDM 2.0 conformant attestations that make use of an underlying JSON-LD based semantic model (which in turn builds on the common vocabulary/ontology > a combination of SKOS and OWL, with attestation specific restrictions in SHACL).

If use cases are only focusing on mDocs and SD-JWT, this kinda cuts off our hands. Plain JSON schemas are simply no enough.
