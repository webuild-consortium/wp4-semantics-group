# WE BUILD WP4 Semantics Group

Driven from the needs of the use cases, the Semantics Group is creating the semantic model for the WE BUILD project.

Github is used for creating the vocabulary including datamodel and ontology, classes, properties and some other aspects of the semantic model.

A working version is temporarily published here: https://ebw-vocabulary.spherity.dev/ebw

The nordics interoperability platform is used for defining the concepts. Links are included in the vocabulary.
